The session is terminated and removed from the context after this operation finishes.\nICT_Charset - The encoding used for the received characters (for instance ''MS932'' for Japanese Windows).

This should be the second operation in a telnet sequence after Send Username.  It should be configured to wait for the telnet server to emit a password prompt prior to sending the password.\n\nInputs\:\nPassword - The password to send to the remote host.\nICT_Host - The host to execute the command on.\nICT_Port - The port telnet is running on.\nICT_Session - A unique name for the telnet session this command is run from.\nICT_PwdWaitMode - How to wait for the response\: ''none'' - do not wait, ''any'' - wait for any response, ''match'' - wait for response to match the regular expression. Defaults to none. Should be "match" to wait for a password prompt\nICT_PwdTermExpr - The expression to match the server's response before sending the command.  This should match the password prompt of the target server.\nICT_LastInSession - If set to ''true'', this is deemed the last operation in the session. The session is terminated and removed from the context after this operation finishes.  This should typically be false for Send Password.\nICT_Charset - The encoding used for the received characters (for instance ''MS932'' for Japanese Windows). Defaults to UTF-8.\n\nResponses\:\nsuccess - Operation succeeded.\nfailure - Operation failed.\n\nReturns - The standard output of the telnet command.\n\nAuthentication Note\:\nBy default this operation expects a "Password\: " or "password\: " prompt.  If the target system has a different password prompt this operation will need to be copied and modified to expect the appropriate password prompt.  After copying this operation to a writable folder, modify the regular expression in the "ICT_PwdTermExpr" input that will match the password prompt on the target system. Then modify the "Output String" rule for the success response to not match a new login prompt or the message of the day after a successful login to the system.\n</pre>
